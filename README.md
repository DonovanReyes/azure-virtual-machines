<h3>NOTE</h3>
- Using virutal machines at times can be confusing as the desktop can mirror your personal computer's desktop. If you ever forget if you are on your vitual machine or your personal computer, follow this simple list.


 - First in the windows search bar type cmd which will highlight the Command Prompt app.
 - Open Command Prompt and type hostname followed by pressing the enter button.
 - Finally type whoami followed by the enter button.
 - Take note of how you can see that you are logged on in the Virtual Machine that you created on Azure.

-  Be sure to clean up and DELETE ALL your resources when you are done using your VMs, as they will eat up your credits behind the scenes!
